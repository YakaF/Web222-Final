                In the era of rapid technological development, many new technologies have emerged. 
                The more people who use technology, the more people will have a demand for using user interface, 
                because new companies or new computer technologies often require web / application and Software, 
                those 3 kinds of user interfaces appear at the same time, then how to put the same pile of things into 
                3 different user interfaces with good functions and proper proportion, but each interface has ever-changing sizes,
                this is the important point of responsive design. For example, the communication software TEAMS we use every day
                needs these 3 different User interfaces, we can see that each interface can be used normally, but they have a little change.
                <br><br>
                If web technologies loses responsive design, it should be a disaster, because people need to design different user interfaces 
                for each different model of machine, which will spend more manpower and material resources on these unimportant things.
                <br><br>
                I have learn HTML5, CSS, using DOM and Javascript to build web page for different devices. 
                Html5 is not a responding language for people to design a responsive web page. But with CSS and Javascript, 
                we can control the size of an image or a paragraph within certain conditions.

                In my experience in this course, this is a very fun course at all, I enjoying the success of coding.
                But I hate that there were too many functions to remember. Itâ€™s almost not possible to remember them all.
                So it always confused me that how IT developer remember them all. I know I just learned a tip of an iceberg, and my road to a developer is long away...
